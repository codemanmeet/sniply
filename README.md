# Sniply

A simple snippet sharing site. You can see the site live at [sniply.co](http://sniply.co).

##Getting Started

Sniply has been testing on Ruby 1.9.3.

Copy the `database.yml` for your setup. For SQLite3, `cp config/database.yml.sqlite3 config.database.yml` and for MySQL `cp config/database.yml.mysql config.database.yml` and update for your username/password.

This isn't required in development but highly recommened for production. Run `rake secret` and copy what it gives you and replace whatever is next to `Sniply::Application.config.secret_token = ` in `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`.

* gem install bundler
* bundle install
* rake db:create:all
* rake db:migrate

You need to create an application on the [Twitter Developer](https://dev.twitter.com) site. When creating a new application, set the 'callback URL' as the `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`. Copy the 'consumer key' and the 'consumer secret' keys into `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` replacing `ENV['SNIPLY_TWITTER_KEY']` and `ENV['SNIPLY_TWITTER_SECRET']`. 

When in production, the 'callback URL' needs to be changed to your site URL with `/auth/callback` on the end. Also you should set the environment variables set for `SNIPLY_TWITTER_KEY` and `SNIPLY_TWITTER_SECRET`. You can paste these into your source code but it is a security risk. You should keep these details secret.

Once everything is setup, start up the server with `rails server` and direct your web browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Login with Twitter and you will be greeted with a new snippet form.
